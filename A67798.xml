         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat which embolden'd me to dedicate theſe our Labours to your Honour, was my knowledge, that this Subject would have ſome affinity to your Curious and Philoſophical Mind, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Work may be too weak to anſwer your excellent Parts, yet when we conſider that our deſign is only to ſerve the Publick, we thought none ſo fit to Patronize and Encourage the ſame as your
<pb facs="tcp:43169:3"/>ſelf, ſeeing your learned Writings do manifeſt, that your whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is for the ſame end, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoſe many ſublime Truths, that have paſſed from your Pen into the World, ſhew your great Qualifications, and have raiſed <hi>your Fame</hi> far beyond what we are able to ſet forth: For we can aſſure you, and that from experience, that 'tis ſpread like the <hi>Romiſh Eagle;</hi> for in our <hi>European</hi> Travels we have heard the ſame expreſſed from the mouth of the moſt learned Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, calling you the <hi>Phoenix of the Age,</hi> ſeeing your Labours have been ſo profitable for Mankind; and for this reaſon we thought it not impertinent humbly to preſent this, the rough Draught of our Hard Labours unto your Correction and candid Cenſure, knowing there is
<pb facs="tcp:43169:3"/>none a more competent Judge than your ſelf; therefore if favour'd with your acceptance, we ſhall not value the Cenſures of thoſe that wholly bend their Wits to ſearch into the depth of other Mens Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, with a deſign more to carp upon them, than any deſire to be edified thereby; theſe are the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes that we meet with in this polliſhed Age, we mean by ſuch that are ſo ſcholaſtically adorned with the <hi>Theory of Science,</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſign to be acquainted with the <hi>Practice</hi> thereof: but letting ſuch paſs, I ſhall addreſs my ſelf to your Honour; for that we have ſeen your Writings are <hi>Practical,</hi> and that you do endeavour to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Mother of Science</hi> by the firm Pillars of <hi>Truth,</hi> and always have been found ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

               </gap>st in the Vail of Miſery: we mean thoſe parts of Art, grounded upon
<pb facs="tcp:43169:6"/>known and practical Demonſtration, and that center upon true Knowledge in the <hi>Ocean of Nature,</hi> as it ſtreams forth into its various Rivulets, or as the vivifying Spirit thereof operates in its ſeveral <hi>Claſſes,</hi> and as the various and particular Signatures are known, ſo may various profitable Truths be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; amongst which, the changing of <hi>Engliſh Spirits</hi> from one thing to another, is of principal Conſequence, and a very profitable Truth.</p>
            <p>For if you know how by an Artificial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification from the Chaos of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to bereave them of their Hogo and ill Tangue, bringing them ſweet and pleaſant, then may you introduce a Vinor, friendly and agreeable Nature, more healthful for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Conſtitutions than the foreign Brandies, and the more eſpecially if you make uſe of our <hi>Sal Panariſtos,</hi> by which they are eaſily brought to mellow, and to a fragrant Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Nature; we then ſay, if you know this, you may boldly depend on it as a Door of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to many profitable Truths.</p>
            <p>And again, Were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> but ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious as the <hi>Germans</hi> in this <hi>Chymical Art,</hi> why might not the Poor be imployed to gather all ſorts of Herbs in their prime, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            <p>Wipe your Eyes therefore, and rouze up

            <p>Accept therefore of our good Inclination, in that the greatest part of our deſign is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſome ſteps towards the Publick Good, which ought indeed to be backed on by ſuch who have the Staff in their hands, and can at any time erect or cauſe to be erected a publick place, where profitable Truths might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, and regiſter'd in a Book, there to remain for the good of Poſterities to come: By ſuch a Method might Art be ſo advanced as daily to encreaſe and raiſe ſome ſplendor to the <hi>Britanniſh Iſland,</hi> which being but as a little Garden, in compariſon of the Chriſtian

               <hi>Chymicus Rationalis:</hi> OR, THE Fundamental Grounds OF THE CHIMICAL ART, Rationally STATED and DEMONSTRATED.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Treats concerning ſeveral Rational and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Rules in this Art.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter we ſhall begin to conſider the <hi>Chymical</hi> and <hi>Spagirical Doctrines,</hi> and lay them down in thoſe ways, that may ſeem moſt agreeable to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but before we proceed to our Matter intended, we think it convenient to ſhew the Reader, what we mean by the words <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43169:10"/>and <hi>Spagirical,</hi> which ſome define to be one and the ſame; but the Definition we give of them is thus:</p>
               <p>By the word <hi>[Chymical]</hi> thou may'ſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, all ſuch Operations as are made in order to divide the Texture of Bodies, and to bring them into their diſtinct Elements or Principles, in ſuch a manner that the true <hi>Spagirick</hi> may ſeparate the pure from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, which (if perform'd in the moſt natural way) may contribute much in the haſtening his Operation; but here he muſt be very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for in this action the inviſible Life is often put to flight, as we have ſaid in the <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Magazine,</hi> chap. 2. where thou may'ſt ſee more at large.</p>
               <p>By <hi>[Spagirical]</hi> thou may'ſt underſtand all ſuch Operations, as reunite thoſe before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Principles into a radical union, or that can reſtore a new life into a <hi>conflagrated</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according as we ſaid in the afore cited Chapter.</p>
               <p>So that one part may be eſteemed of as for Preparation, the other for Exaltation and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection through the ſeveral Revolutions of Art, which cannot be perform'd, but by the help of Furnaces, and divers Utilencies, which we ſhall think convenient to nominate and lay down, with a general Deſcription of a Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, according as we ſhall erect in our <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demia Spagirica nova,</hi> by ſuch a Scale and Table of Proportions, as hath not been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to practiſed by; firſt we ſhall ſnew their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43169:10"/>and then their Office; as to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection 'tis by a Scale of equal parts, which is hung up in the <hi>Chymical Laboratory,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Table by the firſt Figure, which is here deſcribed, <hi>A B C</hi> is the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, and <hi>A B</hi> the Line of Proportion, and <hi>F</hi> the Table containing the divers Proportions for the heighth, length and breadth of the Furnaces, as thou may'ſt ſee in the Figure.</p>
               <p>Now by the help of this Scale you may erect theſe following Furnaces, <hi>viz. Balneums, Sand Furnaces, Open Fires,</hi> and <hi>Reverberato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Wind Furnaces, Digeſters, Athanors,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Balneum</hi> is either a large Iron <hi>Dutch</hi> Pot, or Copper Pan ſet in Brick, as will be ſhewn hereafter: Its uſes are many, for being filled with Water, and the Veſſels you put in well twiſted about with Hay, and ty'd to a leaden Triſoot to ſink them; you may there diſſolve all kind of <hi>Gums,</hi> and the beſt way to <hi>rectifie fine Spirits</hi> from their Flegm, and to bring over the <hi>friendly</hi> and <hi>balſamick Virtue</hi> of <hi>Concrets fragrant,</hi> which in Sand would burn and get an evil ſmell, eſpecially if <hi>Myrrh, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, Saffron</hi> or <hi>Honey</hi> be concerned in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; Now 'tis to be obſerv'd in the uſe of theſe <hi>Balneums,</hi> that the Water exhaling is to be ſupplied with Water of an equal heat, pour'd through a long Funnel, that will reach to the bottom, otherwiſe you endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger your Glaſs.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43169:11"/>
               <p>Now <hi>Aſhes</hi> are a degree hotter than a <hi>B.</hi> and are for the <hi>Rectification of Vegetable Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Sand</hi> is a degree hotter than <hi>Aſhes,</hi> and is for the <hi>Rectification of Mineral Spirits,</hi> as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Vitriol,</hi> and the like. Now obſerve, that in <hi>Sand</hi> you may heat your Glaſs very hot, and draw <hi>Oyl of Amber,</hi> and force over pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Spirits, it being little ſhort of an <hi>open Fire,</hi> and will ſerve well to <hi>Sublime Mercury</hi> in: we ſay then, that if Iron Pots of various ſizes be ſo placed, that the Fire may play round them, they are excellent for drawing <hi>Spirit of Hartſhorn, Spirit of Salt,</hi> and <hi>Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> as well as <hi>Glauber's Furnace,</hi> eſpecially if you uſe good earthen Caps, double glazed within and without, and more eſpecially if you uſe Iron ones, for there is a great Error in this Caſe committed by the <hi>common Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;</hi> for they uſe Caps made of Copper, and that doth not only give the Spirit an ill tangue, but alſo doth cauſe it to loſe its clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and, after various Rectifications, to turn red, which to prevent, you may have Iron Caps caſt very thin of various ſizes to fit the Iron Pots, with a Ring above to draw it up: for in ſuch a Cap you may draw any <hi>urinous Spirit</hi> as ſweet as in any Glaſs, not only theſe, but you may draw <hi>Oyl of Amber</hi> in them in a moſt excellent manner, therefore recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the uſe of all <hi>Artiſts.</hi> The Form and Manner of theſe <hi>Sand Furnaces, Pots</hi> and <hi>Caps</hi> are deſcribed in the ſecond Figure.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43169:11"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Open Fires</hi> and <hi>Reverberatories,</hi> are for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ponderous Spirits,</hi> and <hi>ſubliming Mineral Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and the <hi>large Reverberatories</hi> for drawing <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> in quantity; the Veſſel requiſite to be uſed here is a Glaſs Retort coated, or <hi>German</hi> or Earthen one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wind Furnace,</hi> is for the <hi>Melting of Metals, Making of Regulus, Calcining of Metals</hi> and <hi>Salts,</hi> and if 'tis made according to our Directions in the Figure, it may well ſerve for <hi>Cementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Teſting</hi> and <hi>Cuppelling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athanors</hi> and <hi>Digeſters,</hi> are of various ſorts, each to be regiſtred to various degrees of heat, ſome for <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> others for <hi>Digeſtion</hi> and <hi>Circulation.</hi> Alſo, if you are curious, you may have ſuch an heat as is meet for hatching of Eggs or maturating Sperm or Seed, which by the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> was called the <hi>Clibannical Heat:</hi> theſe are really neceſſary to make up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Laboratory,</hi> with addition of thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the firſt part, <hi>ſc.</hi> a Copper Still with its Refrigetory, and an Alembick, the Office of which is there ſhewn.</p>
               <p>As we have given their Name and Office, we ſhall now come to ſhew the Uſe of the Scale of Proportion in Erecting Furnaces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou deſign to build a <hi>B.</hi> or <hi>Sand Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> thou muſt firſt meaſure by the Scale of equal parts, how many equal parts the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> or Pot is, and then look in the Table and ſee for that Number in the Line <hi>A,</hi> and look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43169:12"/>in the Line <hi>B,</hi> and you there have the height of the Pot, and under, in the Line <hi>C,</hi> you have the Diſtance of the Pot from the Grate, and under, in the Line <hi>D,</hi> you have the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Grate to the Foundation-work, and in the Line <hi>E,</hi> the bigneſs of the Foundation-work, and in the Line <hi>F,</hi> the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Grate, room for the Fire to play in, and bigneſs of the Flew, and in the Line <hi>G,</hi> the heighth of the Furnace, thus explained by Figure the ſecond, <hi>C</hi> is the Pot or <hi>B.</hi> 14 equal parts Diameter, and 16 high, then range under to the Line <hi>E,</hi> and there you'l ſee the Foundation muſt be laid 26 Inches or equal parts, that is 14 for the Pot, 8 for the Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and 4 for the Fire to play round the Pot, for you are to obſerve, that the breadth of a Brick is thickneſs ſufficient for any Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace whether the Wall be ſquare or round: Now the Foundation being laid, then look to the Line <hi>D,</hi> and you have the Diſtance from the Foundation to the Grate, which is 10 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts, and then you muſt leave an Air-hole ſquare, half the bigneſs of this: and twice the bigneſs of your Air-hole muſt always be the bigneſs of your Grate. Your Grate being laid, then look to the Line <hi>C</hi> and you've the Diſtance of the Pot from the Grate, which is 9 Inches; theſe being added together with the heighth of the Pot, give the heighth of your Furnace, only adding an Inch for the Grate; ſo here the Aſh-hole being 10 Inches, and one the Grate, and 9 from the Grate to
<pb facs="tcp:43169:12"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:43169:13"/>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43169:13"/>the Pot, which makes 20, to which add 16, the heighth of the Pot, that makes up 36, the heighth of the Furnace, which is to be found in the Line <hi>G.</hi> Now your Door to put the Fire in muſt always be half the bigneſs of the Grate, I mean in ſquare and regular Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now what Diſtance you allow your Fire to play round the Pot, the Air-hole muſt be the fourth part thereof, as you may ſee in the Table.</p>
               <p>This Table is of great uſe in projecting all kind of Furnaces, but we ſhall only deſcribe three; which are repreſented in Figure 3d, 4th, and 5th. The firſt is a <hi>Wind Furnace,</hi> for performing all the aforeſaid Operations attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted thereunto. The ſecond is both a <hi>Wind Furnace</hi> and <hi>Reverberatory,</hi> and ſerveth for <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting</hi> and <hi>Cupelling, Digeſting, Diſtilling</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liming,</hi> and many other Operations. The third is a <hi>Philoſophical Furnace</hi> or <hi>Oven,</hi> which if rightly made will ſerve for all the Intentions in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> which we will particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, beginning with Figure the ſecond. <hi>A A,</hi> is the Foundation-work, 26 Inches; <hi>B,</hi> the Aſh-hole, 5 Inches; <hi>C,</hi> the Grate, 10 Inches; <hi>D,</hi> the Door or Stopper, 5; <hi>H,</hi> the the <hi>Balneum</hi> or Pot; <hi>E E,</hi> the Fire-place that plays round it; <hi>A F,</hi> the heighth of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; <hi>G,</hi> the Retort; <hi>I,</hi> the Mouth where he cloſes in the Receiver; <hi>K,</hi> the Receiver; <hi>L,</hi> the Triſoot the Receiver lies on, as may be ſeen in the Figure.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:43169:14"/>
               <p>Figure the third deſcribed <hi>A A,</hi> the Ground-work; <hi>B,</hi> the Aſh-hole, 6 Inches; <hi>G,</hi> the Grate, 12 Inches; <hi>C C,</hi> the Door or Stopper, 10 high and 8 broad; <hi>D D,</hi> a hole to look in, of 4 Inches ſquare; <hi>A E,</hi> the heighth of the Furnace, 36; <hi>E F,</hi> the heighth of the Flew; which obſerve in all theſe Wind Furnaces, the higher they be the better they draw.</p>
               <p>Figure the Fourth deſcribed: <hi>A A,</hi> the Ground-work; <hi>B,</hi> a vacant Arch to put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Coals or what you pleaſe; <hi>E,</hi> the Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole; <hi>G,</hi> the Grate; <hi>D,</hi> the Door of the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place; <hi>F,</hi> the Hole that plays into the <hi>Cuppel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Furnace; M,</hi> the Hole to put in the Teſts; <hi>I,</hi> a Hole to clean the Furnace; <hi>K,</hi> the Flew to carry up the Smoak; <hi>L,</hi> a large ſtone that covers the Furnace; <hi>P,</hi> a great Iron Bar on which the Retort lies; <hi>Q,</hi> the Retort; <hi>R,</hi> a Fire-ſtone, or 14 inch Tile, that lies over it; <hi>S,</hi> the Flew to carry away the Smoak when the <hi>Teſting Furnace</hi> doth not go; <hi>T,</hi> the Receiver; <hi>U,</hi> the Trivet for the Receiver to lye on, as in the Figure.</p>
               <p>The Dimenſions and Deſcriptions of the fifth Furnace: <hi>A A,</hi> is the Foot of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance 15 equal parts, and the heighth of the Foot from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>B</hi> 12 equal parts; from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>B</hi> let it be 12 equal parts, but let the Virge come inward for a Grate 11 to reſt thereon; let there be a Door in the Foot from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>S</hi> 6 Inches ſquare to take out the Aſhes, and let the Body of the Furnace ſhut into the Virge,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43169:14"/>as at <hi>B B,</hi> and let it be from thence 18 equal parts high, which is from <hi>D</hi> to <hi>H,</hi> and the like Diameter, that is from <hi>I</hi> to <hi>H,</hi> and let there be a Door in the Body of the Furnace from <hi>D</hi> to <hi>F</hi> 8 Inches ſquare, to put in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Crucible: oppoſite againſt it let there be a Pipe of 6 Inches diameter, and 6 long, and to convey the Fire into another Furnace, if there be occaſion; and at other times let there be a Cover, as at <hi>R,</hi> to ſhut it faſt; let the Body of the Furnace be of Copper, lined within with good Lute and thin Tiles, two Inches thick the better to defend it from the Fire; let there be within a Copper Pan, to take out upon occaſion, and put in, the which may ſerve for a <hi>B.</hi> let there be in the Brim a Door of 4 parts or Inches, as at <hi>e.e.</hi> and let there be in the bottom, juſt above the Grate, a Pipe for the Noſe of a pair of Bellows to go in at; and let the Door in the Brim be to let down, to put out the Neck of a Retort upon occaſion; let there be a tapering Tower from <hi>I H</hi> to <hi>P,</hi> 36 parts high, and at <hi>I H</hi> let it be 18 Inches diameter, and to ſhut cloſe upon the ſame; let it be to take off at <hi>L K,</hi> where let it be 10 parts diameter, and at <hi>T U</hi> let it be 6 parts diameter, with a Cover, as at <hi>P,</hi> and a Verg fill'd with Sand, by which all the heat may be kept in the ſmall Pipe, as at <hi>O.</hi> The Pipe of the Wind Furnace, upon occaſion, when you make of it a Teſt or a Cupelling Furnace, let it be to take off at <hi>X;</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Work, as at <hi>Y Z,</hi> muſt be of Boards, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>This Oven thus ordered, will perform all the Operations that are needful in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> let it be of what Nature ſoever, a <hi>Reverberation, Calcination, Sublimation, Violent Diſtillation,</hi> even to draw the <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>gentle Diſtillation in Sand</hi> and <hi>B.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> In which we ſhall first treat of Vinor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and their Office in the Extraction of Tinctures, and ſome other Spagirick Preparations.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter we ſhall treat concerning <hi>Vinor Spirits,</hi> which indeed are the moſt principal of the two general <hi>Claſſes,</hi> ſc. <hi>Vinor</hi> and <hi>Urinous;</hi> for that the <hi>Vinor Spirits</hi> do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to us the Nature of the <hi>Callidum inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or the enriched Sulphur manifeſted in a Spiritual Form, as the Oils do in a more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous one, becauſe by Fermentation the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality is ſeparated from the ſaline, corporeal and aqueous parts, which would be very hard to be performed, was it not by the action of Fermentation; for which reaſon we ſhall now proceed to deſcribe the Nature and Office thereof.</p>
               <p>We therefore ſay, that even <hi>common Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> is a wonderful and myſterious Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for ripe Bodies are not only again made ſpiritual, but Spirits alſo are by it fix'd and made corporeal, therefore we ſhall want words fully to illuſtrate this Doctrine, as it might be handled both in its natural and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Office: We ſhall therefore define it thus,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43169:19"/>
                  <hi>That Fermentation is the way to Production,</hi> as is plainly manifeſt by the <hi>Mechanick Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations</hi> the learned <hi>Cartes</hi> and his Diſciples give thereof, which we ſhall briefly touch at and paſs on to its Office, beginning firſt with the Artificial, and ſecondly touching at the Natural.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Artificial Office of Fermentation,</hi> is that by which Bodies are broken and dilated, in order to ſeparate their Spirituality from their Corporeity, and brought to a Vinor Spirit: for all <hi>Fruits, Treacle, Sugar</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> by the addition of <hi>Herbs, Roots, Barks</hi> and <hi>Spices,</hi> through Fermentation yield a noble Spirit, as is ſaid in our <hi>Britannean Magazine</hi> of <hi>Liquors,</hi> to which I refer you for ſatisfaction, and (God willing) in the next Impreſſion this Doctrine ſhall be there more largely treated of, and therefore omitted here.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Natural Fermentation</hi> is that which unites the Saline Mercurial Juice with the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur or Form of Bodies, ſo as to produce or uphold the Radical Moiſture, which nouriſhes and upholds concreted Beings, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aſſumes to itſelf by the <hi>Archeius</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thoſe divers forms, that are ſufficient to uphold the Texture of Beings, as we have ſaid <hi>in our general Treatiſe of Diſeaſes:</hi> wherefore <hi>Artificial Fermentation</hi> is a ſeparation of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and <hi>Natural</hi> is a Concretion and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: therefore 'tis ſaid by the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> that <hi>Fermentation is the Key to Generation;</hi> the manner how we have largely treated of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43169:19"/>in <hi>Doctrinâ Principium;</hi> we ſhall therefore paſs off from the <hi>Natural,</hi> and come to ſpeak of the Office of thoſe Spirits that are produced by the <hi>Artificial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Spirit</hi> we define to be the <hi>most eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of that Body, whence extracted,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſulphurous, thin and penetrating Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath virtue and power to act upon other Bodies, and attract to itſelf that part which is moſt homogeneous to it, which general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the ſulphurous, whether <hi>Vinor, Oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,</hi> or <hi>Gummous,</hi> which are the Sulphurs in divers forms; ſometimes the Tinctures are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly changed, and the ſulphurous parts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them variety of Colours, according as the internal Digeſtion and Concoction of Nature is; E. G. Roſes give one, Coche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nele another, Turmerick, or Saffron, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo various Tinctures are produced, as will be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>But by the way, I think it convenient to ſhew the Operator a certain and profitable way to prepare <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave it of all its Flegm, and in a way that it may be homogeneous and the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in its action for obtaining Tinctures.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Eſſential and Chymical Oyls.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter we ſhall treat concerning the Sulphurs of Concrets, <hi>ſc.</hi> the Oyls which are centrally one with the Spirits, but in a more ponderous form, becauſe the parts are not broke by Fermentation, as they are in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Spirits.</hi> There is generally one Rule for making of <hi>Eſſential Oyls, viz.</hi> Maceration and Diſtillation; <hi>Ex. gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>℞ <hi>Wormwood,</hi> or any other dry Herb, pull off all the ſtalks, and put it into a large Tub, and pour upon it warm Water, enough to moiſten it, and two or three handfuls of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitated Bay-Salt, let it ſtand twenty four hours, and diſtil it with a Refrigeratory; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Oyl with a ſeparating Glaſs, <hi>S. A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now obſerve, that ſome Herbs muſt not be over dry, as <hi>Origanum,</hi> and if its Oyl is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled in the coldeſt day of the Winter, when all the Powers of Nature are congealed with cold, and that the Still be ſet where the cold may have power upon it, ſo as to keep the Worm and Water exceeding cold, your Oyls ſhall be congealed into a criſtaline Salt, which I prize more than the Oyls.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:43169:23"/>
               <p>After the manner aforemention'd you may diſtil the Oyls of all Herbs and Berries.</p>
               <p>But obſerve, that <hi>Glauber</hi> objects againſt this way, ſaying that abundance of it is loſt in the Water and Veſſels, by reaſon of their largeneſs.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Fill a Gourd with Cinnamon or any other Wood or Seed, upon which pour ſo much Spirit of Salt, as will be ſufficient to cover the Wood, then place it with its Alembick in Sand, and give it Fire by degrees, that the Spirit of Salt may boil, and all the Oyl will diſtil off with a little Flegm: for the Spirit of Salt doth with its acrimony penetrate the Wood, and freeth the Oyl, that it may diſtil off better and eaſier: and by this way the Oyl is not loſt by the addition of that great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water, in thoſe great and large Veſſels, but is drawn in leſſer Glaſs Veſſels with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a little moiſture. Diſtillation being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the Spirit is poured off by Inclination from the Wood, being again uſeful for the ſame work. And if it hath contracted any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity from the Wood, it may be rectified; but the reſidue of the Spirit, that remains in the Wood; you may recover, if that Wood be caſt in the aforeſaid Furnace upon burning
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43169:23"/>Coals, by which means it may come forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain pure and clear; and by this means we loſe none of the Spirit of Salt. And after this way, by help of the Spirit of Salt, are drawn forth Oyls of dearer Vegetables, together with their Fruit, which cannot be done by a Still.</p>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:43169:28"/>
                  <p>℞ Common Salt and decripitate it, till done cracking, then diſſolve it in clear Fountain Water, and draw off about a fourth part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and then pour in of the beſt Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol ſufficient to alter the form, and in a gentle heat digeſt, and after criſtalize it S.A.

                  <p>Obſerve, that from all Woods, Roots and Herbs, being dry and turned to Aſhes, you may by warm Water extract a Salt; thus is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43169:29"/>made the Salt of Wormwood, Tobacco, and others, which are alſo Alkalies, little different from Tartar, only, what there is, Tartar in virtue excels any other, and therefore not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly called <hi>the Publick Family of Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43169:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſome others, yet with us 'tis in great eſteem, becauſe the Alkaly hath loſt its cauſtick qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Acid its corroſive property, and ſo becomes an excellent Medicine: as not being liable to an alteration by any Ferment in the Body of Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Doſe is from</hi> 10 <hi>or</hi> 15 <hi>Gr. to</hi> 20 <hi>each Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It cleanſeth the Stomach, powerfully reſolving Obſtructions in the Meſeraick Veins, and is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given as a digeſter, abſterſive and cleanſer in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Agues, Jaundies, Scurvy, Worms in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and for cold Crudities in the Stomach, which are the cauſe of many Diſeaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, by the way, we would let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der underſtand, that we are ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd that this Doctrine is ſo little taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; for by it Acid Spirits are not only made ſweet, but alſo the Alkalies by theſe and our Red Wine may be made a powerful and excellent Medicine far above any to be found in common Diſpenſatory, and altho' this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Acid and Alkaly hath been largely treated of by that ingenious and learned <hi>Otto Tachenius,</hi> yet hath he not ſo clearly deliver'd the Practick Part of this, nor indeed hath any that we ever read done it ſo fully, as we wiſh it were, when we conſider the uſefulneſs of it, and therefore we ſhall be the more large in ſhewing our Experience concerning the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Again, in like manner by pouring the Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium</hi> upon the Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is made <hi>Tartarum Nitratum, which is a Salt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43169:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>of more eaſie fuſion than the former, of a nitrous cold taſte, being an excellent Abſterſive in burning and putrid Feavers, Gravel, Heat of Urine, Heat in the Back and Kidneys, Heat in the Stomach, whence a hot and harſh Breath, and many other defects, which are ſeated in the first and ſecond Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo from the Oyl of Sulphur <hi>per Camp.</hi> and Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> is had an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent neutral Salt.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe from the ſtrong Spirit of Salt, or the ſtrong Spirit of Vinegar, (as was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in that Chapter that treats of Oyls) very noble Salts are made, which are yet in a higher degree if united with the purifi'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Tincture of Vegetables, in a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, (the Salt being firſt diſſolved in a little White-wine, or other convenient Liquor) by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting the Salt and Tinctures till both become very clear, for at firſt mixing they will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry muddy, and precipitating a light <hi>Faecula</hi> will at laſt be very clear, decant this clear Liquor, that is ting'd, and in a ſlow fire draw away the moiſture, till the known figure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and in a cool place 'twill criſtalize into a pure Salt tinged with the Tincture of the Vegetable, retaining its Taſte, Odour, and Virtue.</p>
                  <p>Thus out of Hellebore black or white, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, or any other Simple, that will yield a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in Spirit of Wine, a Salt may be made, which is call'd by the name of the Vegetable, with which 'tis joyned, as <hi>the Salt of Hellebore,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43169:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>Opium or Jallop,</hi> &amp;c. which Salts, beſides their abſterſive virtue, have a ſuper-additional and ſpecifick one, according to that of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, by which a ſedulous and induſtrious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician may cure many ſtubborn Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus much we obſerve concerning the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of theſe Salts, that they work in a way agreeable to Nature, and alſo will prepare moſt excellent <hi>Menſtruum's</hi> for diſſolving of Mettals; and as that Famous <hi>George Starkey,</hi> in his Pirotechny aſſerted and illuſtrated, ſays, they are more powerful for opening metalick Bodies, than any other Preparation whatever, whereby Tartar can be volatized, as will be ſhewn in the Chapter wherein we treat of <hi>Menſtruums.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing there are and have been many Conjectures, and various Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Author, and his Doctrines, we think it convenient to give in ours, from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Knowledge of the Truth of his Labours, which is, that he had a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Knowledge in Philoſophy, and we aſſert, that no Man can be his Judge, unleſs a true Son of Wiſdom and Child, that Nature hath got into her School, and qualifi'd with her hidden <hi>Diaploma,</hi> with which he certainly was, in that he trode ſo exactly in her ſteps, and had thoſe parts as to <hi>Medicinal Philoſophy,</hi> that we honour him above moſt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Writers, and had he not been a little ſhort ſighted in ſome things, his Name would have had a laſting Renown, yea in Poſterities and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43169:31"/>Ages to come; the leaſt therefore that we can ſay of him in our Writings is this, <hi>ſc.</hi> that he was a Maſter in <hi>Pirotechny,</hi> the Tryumph of which he promiſed to the World, which would have been a Key to open the <hi>Helmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Doctrines</hi> for the good of the Sons of Art, doubtleſs this Book would long ſince have ſeen the Light, had God ſpared his Life, but the raging Plague, after all his Courage, took him off, by his too venturous opening of a Body whileſt hot, that died of the Plague; but, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope his Soul is at reſt.</p>
                  <p>But now, ſeeing 'tis impoſſible for him to perform what was there promiſed, we ſhall partly for his ſake, (but more eſpecially for Truth itſelf) endeavour to ſupply, by giving as great a light to that which hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly written, as any other Son of Art, hath hitherto done, and 'tis not to be queſtioned, but that Truth will be more cleared up, than hitherto, becauſe (beſides the Knowledge of what they've written and ſet down) we have the advantage of what Dame Experience hath taught us, by exceeding hard and continued Labours in the Fire, which always was and ever will be the true Interpreter of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and that which adorns them alſo: and thus altho' but a Child myſelf, yet 'tis allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, that ſuch, being ſet upon other Mens ſhoulders, can ſee farther than they could; but this by the way: We then ſay, that the Doctrine of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkaly</hi> deſerves a Veneration, ſeeing it deſtroys the Activity of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43169:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>the moſt violent Corroſive, and makes them truly Medicinal; <hi>Ex. Gr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you pour Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium</hi> upon <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and diſtil it off, you ſhall have a Salt left behind, in form of a Niter, and here the <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> is mortified by the Salt of Tartar and both brought to a very good Medicine.</p>
                  <p>Again, 'Tis to be obſerved, that one Acid will mortifie another, and form a Salt. <hi>Ex. Gr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>℞ Spirit of Niter, and Spirit of Vitreol, and Cohobate upon the Spirit of Niter three or four times, and you'l have a Salt left behind, which by an ingenious Man ought not to be diſdained.</p>
                  <p>Wonder not (Courteous Reader) that theſe corroſive Spirits are thus mortified, and their venom taken off, when that they were not originally ſuch in their own nature, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the fire to be ſo corroſive, which you may ſee by the hand of the skilful, may be again corrected; therefore we ſhall ſtate it thus, that <hi>Aq. Fort. A. R.</hi> Spirit and Oyl of Vitreol, Spirit of Salt Peter, or common Salt, are not Poyſons, but Spirits of eminent activity, which, being mingled with Salts, Wine, Beer or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may be taken in a greater quantity (than alone would be mortal) without the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nay, rather they become wholſom and medicinal.</p>
                  <p>Thus vulgar Mercury hath been preſcribed by the Ancients (being rightly prepared) as a choice <hi>Arcanum,</hi> but being ſublimed with Salts,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43169:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>becomes a corroſive Poyſon; but we ſay, that theſe Salts are again mortified, by being ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with new Mercury, as you may ſee in the preparation of that which is call'd <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Dulcis,</hi> which is but a frivolous Toy, yet however 'tis medicinal.</p>
                  <p>We could indeed run out a large Diſcourſe concerning Acids and Alkalies, and their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with highly rectified Spirit of Wine, and their Office, being brought to combination, nay, a regenerated and glorifi'd <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> but ſeeing theſe Preparations come under the Title of <hi>Arcana Pontiſſitata,</hi> we ſhall refer you thither for further ſatisfaction, as alſo to the Chapter of <hi>Menſtruums</hi> in this Book.</p>
                  <p>And thus much ſhall at this time ſuffice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Salts; but we ſhall hereafter ſhew their union with Vegetable and Mineral Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, as alſo with Urinous Spirits, of which we ſhall now come to treat.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous Spirits in general.</head>
               <p>URinous Spirits are to be defined, <hi>Spirits drawn from the excrementitious part of Bodies,</hi> and altho' they are many times us'd by nature, in making up of Compounds, yet their <hi>Claſſes</hi> are not ſo general, as that of Vinor: for Vinor Spirits and Sulphurs (which are indeed but the Sulphurs in another diſguiſe, as is manifeſt from their central unity, in the tranſmutation of Form) are eaſily inflamable alike, being the <hi>Callidum innatum,</hi> or form of Beings, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual part of the Body, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. deſcrib'd, and as we have ſaid in our <hi>Britanean Magazine,</hi> that all Fruits, Seeds and Roots will by Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation yield a Vinor Spirit; wherefore in the foregoing Chapter we defin'd Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be an Inlet to Production; for without it Honey or Moloſſus could never be brought to yield their Vinor Spirits, nor the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man change his Barly into Malt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this Chapter we muſt define Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the Mother of Generation, for that 'tis by this that Urinous Spirits are brought forth, and although not ſo univerſal as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, yet becauſe Nature does often make uſe of their eſſential parts in compoſition, we ſhall define them to be matter ſpiritualized, and to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43169:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>be in degrees of purity according as they have adherence to the ſubſtantial or excremental part of Bodies; for in theſe the Form is often precipitated, and the Univerſal Spirit is by them made into Earth; for as <hi>Sandivog. ſays in his Treatiſe of Sulphur, that he took two Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies of a different ſubſtance, but one original, which Saturn waſhed in his own Urin, and call'd them the Sulphur of Sulphurs,</hi> which indeed is nothing elſe but the <hi>glaſſy Azoth,</hi> or <hi>Vitreol of Venus Philoſophical,</hi> which is the Univerſal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit made into Earth; but more of this in its proper place.</p>
               <p>Now under this Head or Denomination of Urinous Spirits, are thoſe of Blood, and the excrementitious part of the Microcoſm, <hi>ſc.</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; as alſo all kind of Bones, Horns and Hoofs, and many kind of Salts, as <hi>Salt Gem. Sal Armoniack,</hi> and all Volatile Salts fix'd by Acids, for all of theſe will give an Urinous Spirit, and a Volatile Alkalizated Salt, as is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be demonſtrated by an Acid with a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Oyl, eſpecially from Scot, Blood and Hartſhorn, which Spirits, Salt and Sulphur do repreſent the three diſtinct Principles, that are contained in every concreted Body, and there is no being in the Univerſal Fabrick of Nature, whoſe Texture can be upheld with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the union of theſe Principles, nay, inpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity too; for that's it, that gives durability in the Animal, Mineral, and Vegetable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:43169:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Now the Union of the three Principles ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates and produces a Neutral Spirit of an Hermophroditical Nature, that is, neither Male nor Female, Acid nor Alkaly: Now 'tis to be obſerved in all generations, that Sulphur acts the part of the Male, and Mercury the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and Sulphur is that, which gives Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her determinated Form and Fixation; but here firſt you muſt deſtroy him of his Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Robes, and reduce him to a ſaline and mercurial Nature, then you may for certain reckon yourſelf in the number of Natures moſt Ingenious Scholars; the way how this is done, I have ſhewed in my <hi>Magician's Magazine,</hi> to which we refer the Reader as ſoon as it comes to light; therefore omitting it here, ſhall paſs on to our deſigned Task, <hi>ſc.</hi> The Regular Progreſſion in Urinous Spirits.</p>
               <p>But only, by the way, we think it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to add a word to prevent Criticks, and ſuch as underſtand not the Foundation of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who may ſay, that we have denied our Doctrine before aſſerted, <hi>ſc.</hi> That there be three Principles in the Concretion of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Being, by alledging we have here made mention but of two, <hi>ſc.</hi> Sulphur and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but by this we aſſent to the Salt, which is under the Mercurial Form; for the Salt is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily converted into Mercury, and Mercury into Salt, as is ſaid in the <hi>Cline Bore;</hi> the truth of which we are able to maintain againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: But let us return to</p>

                  <head>The Anatomy of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, and Way to be made uſe of in the Preparation of its Spirit.</head>
                  <p>We ſay then, that Urine is a Subject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining very many Properties, which may be many ways advantageous; for 'tis a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Ens,</hi> not only that of the great World, but alſo that of the leſſer; for Man bears a ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing harmony with the Univerſe, both in the Natural, Celeſtial and Intellectual World, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his center Immortality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we know that God's Works are uniform, and that every leſs bears ſome Analogy or Emblance with a greater, and Man being the chief of all ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things, we may thus define him, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of all Forms, an Epitome of all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a comprehenſive Syſtem of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the manner of Philoſophers therefore we have treated (in our ſecond Debate of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertes Soladini</hi>) of the <hi>immortal Diſſolvent</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Head, telling that 'twas contained in Blood and Urine, but with all have defined what that Blood and Urine is, and ſeeing this Subject is ſo largely handled there, we ſhall here omit it, and come to ſpeak concerning the Urine of ſound Men, of which <hi>Helmont</hi> gives this <hi>Encomium,</hi> where he compares it with the <hi>Immortal Liquor,</hi> ſaying that in the whole Syſtem of the Univerſe, It hath not its Fellow or Compare, neither Sea-Salt nor Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Salt,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43169:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>Salt-Petre, Sal-Gem. nor any natural Salt whatever, no nor the Salt of the Urine of Beaſts, which is not in any wiſe comparable to it.</p>
                  <p>But as nothing is more eaſie to come by, ſo on the other hand, nothing is more hard to be worked on, for he that can from it obtain a Spirit, that is neither Acid nor Alkaly, but wholly Saline, ſhall have no cauſe to repent his time and coſt beſtowed on it, eſpecially if he work upon that of <hi>old Saturn;</hi> and that we may contribute our Mite into the Treaſures of Philoſophy, we ſhall give our Experience in the Preparation thereof.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing you are to obſerve is, that Urinous Spirits are prepared through putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the Vinor are by fermentation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Attoms are unlock'd and ſet at liberty, that the fire may have power to bring it to a more exalted ſtate. As for Example:</p>
                  <p>℞ The Urine of ſound People, and put it into a wooden Tub, or large earthen Pots; ſome do it in Glaſs, ſaying 'twill not ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally putrifie in the Wood as Glaſs, and then they ſet it in a gentle heat, equal to that of the Horſe-belly, for the ſpace of 6 or 7 Weeks, for in this Climate 'twill hardly putrifie ſooner, then they diſtil a Spirit from it; others putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it the like time, being put three Foot deep in the Earth, and leave the Glaſs mouth to come open to the Air, looking upon it as the moſt natural of all other ways, ſaying that in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43169:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>Body of the Earth is that internal heat that brings all things to an alteration of Form or Maturation thereof; others are very buſie with their Horſe-dung, and <hi>B. M.</hi> and many others, which we ſhall here paſs by, and ſpeak of that which beſt pleaſes us, which is a Putrifaction in the Air; for that will attract many Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneities from it, and ſo 'twill become more ſweet in ſmell.</p>
                  <p>Take Urine thus truly putrifi'd, and put it into a Retort, and in B. or Sand ſet it to work, and diſtil from 10 Quarts the firſt five, in which is contained the spirit and volatile Salt, but that which remains in the Retort, is the Gum or Oyl, the uſe of which will be ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: Now the five Quarts of Spirit muſt be put into a clean Retort, and you may diſtil from it four Quarts, which you may afterward rectifie to what heighth you pleaſe, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to a Quart or a Pint; but in every Rectification, be ſure not to diminiſh above ſix or eight Ounces at a time; and thus you obtain a Volatile Spirit and Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, which is no way inflamable.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, That ſome both draw and rectifie this Spirit from Calx vive; but others through the Salt of Tartar.</p>
                  <p>℞ Of this rectifi'd Spirit <abbr>lb</abbr>j, of our pure Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial Spirit, rectifi'd through Tartar <abbr>lb</abbr>iij, and in a ſhort time 'twill coagulate into a Volatile Salt, and if you diſtil in a Body and Head,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43169:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>there will ſublime in the Helm near half a Pound of dry active Salt, and ſome Liquor will come over in a fiery form, the reſt will remain in the bottom like a ſtinking flat Flegm, which caſt away; to what Liquor is come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, add freſh Spirit of Wine ſo much as will make it up <abbr>lb</abbr>iij, and put this upon your ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Salt, and diſtil and ſublime as before; and by repeating this Operation, you will have more of the fiery Liquor come over, and Salt ſublime as before; turn this Wheel with freſh Spirit of Wine twelve times, and the fiery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will each time be encreaſed, and your Salt will be moſt of it reduced to this fiery Liquor, and this we call the Vinor Hermaphrodite, or a Neutral <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which will extract good Tinctures from the Calx of any Mettal; but as to its Office, 'twill be treated of more at large in the Chapter of <hi>Menſtruums.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, That after the firſt diſtillation, the <hi>Cap. mort.</hi> that remains, may be calcined in a ſtrong Fire, and then taken out and beat into groſs Powder, and let it be diſſolved by 🝞, and then filter it; then add to every ℥vj of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor or Oyl, ℥jſs of the ſtrongeſt and beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Spirit of Niter, or Spirit of Niter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentricated, and that will cauſe the greater part of the white ſulphurous Earth to ſeparate by precipitation.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43169:40"/>and will be compreſſed by the Fire, but if it were liquid, the Rules in Chymiſtry are not to fill the Veſſels or Retorts above a third part, or at moſt one half full, and the Receiver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luted on, at firſt you muſt give a gentle Fire for 6 hours, increaſe a little higher to the ſecond degree, and continue for 12 hours, and then for 6 more let it be kept to the higheſt degree you can, ſo as the Pot may remain red the whole time; and when the Operation is finiſhed, you will ſee no more Fumes come forth which, if you work right, will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in 24 hours: It comes thus; Firſt a Flegm with a yellow Spirit and volatile Salt in divers figures, and a deep blackiſh and fetid Oyl, and your <hi>Caput mort.</hi> black and burned, which afterwards may be calcin'd in a Potter's Furnace to make burned Hartſhorn of; and thus are the different qualities ſeparated, which may be further thus operated upon: Let what comes over remain together for about 20 days in a convenient Veſſel in a gentle heat, that ſo as much of the Oyl, as will, may ſallifie; then ſeparate the Oyl from the Spirit and Salt by a Funnel, the which rectifie through the Spirit of Salt, as is in the Chapter of Oyls taught; and what Salt is formed by the acid Spirit muſt be ſublimed from its impurity, and added into the firſt Spirit: and then the Spirit muſt be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd two or three times from its Flegm by the addition of the pure Salt of Tartar, and ſo 'twill come exceeding pure. The Infallible Rule to know when the Flegm begins to come, is this,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43169:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Salt will begin to condenſe and fall to the bottom of the Receiver, then you may let all cool, for the Spirit is clearly off: This is the Spirit and Salt truly prepared, which may as yet receive ſeveral degrees of exaltation: <hi>but however as 'tis, it is a ſubtil, penetrating and active Spirit, and operates as is ſaid of the Spirit of Sal-Armoniack, and opens thoſe Obſtructions, that are the cauſe of preternatural Convulſions, and hath a ſpecifick virtue in many Diſeaſes, and correcteth vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Poyſons, and therefore highly to be valued; for I've known thoſe who have gone about to poyſon themſelves, by taking a large quantity of Arſnick, yet this being timely diſcover'd, the miſchief hath been prevented, by giving large and repeated Doſes of the Spirit of Hartſhorn: 'tis excellent alſo for thoſe that are poyſoned with Antimonial Fumes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now we ſay, that if this Spirit is united with its Oyl, twill be much more the highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched thereby: thus, Let your Oyl be drawn off from an Alkaly, and the Spirit radically united with an aromatick Spirit of Wine, and that again united with the Oyl, by Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Circulation and repeated Cohobation, until the Salt, Spirit and Oyl ariſe united; and ſo you have <hi>an eſſentificated Spirit, from Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, Cranium humanum, or what you pleaſe;</hi> and 'tis obſervable, that here the Urinous Foetor is turned to an Aromatick Fragrancy, and <hi>this is a Medicine upon which you may rely, where refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is required, as alſo for ſtrengthening the Brain and Stomack, and if aromatized with Cinnamon or other rich Spices, ſo that the ſpecifick virtue be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43169:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>exalted to the part afflicted, 'twill prove a rich Jewel in the hand of an ingenious Man;</hi> and the more eſpecially if the Principles are brought to a compleat harmony through the <hi>Diâploma</hi> of Art, as is largely ſhewn in our <hi>Spagirick Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy's Tryumph,</hi> to which we refer you: We ſhall therefore conclude this Chapter with this Obſervation, which is, That all Urinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, none excepted, are Volatile Alkalies, as is eaſie to be demonſtrated by their oppoſition to an Acid, making the ſame Efferveſſence as a fixed Alkaly doth, and alſo by the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Acid; for Spirit of Urine will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive Mercury; ſo all Alkalies are noble Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, none excepted: but there is a difference between Alkalies naturally and thoſe that are volatilized artificially; for theſe being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves originally fixed, can never be ſo far alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from their fixed Nature, but that they retain a power to touch the root of all fixed Diſeaſes, by paſſing the Digeſtions and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all preternatural Coagulations they find in the way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concerning which we have written more largely in our <hi>Spagirick Philoſophy's Tryumph,</hi> &amp;c. to which we refer you: And ſo we ſhall end this Chapter concerning <hi>Urinous Spirits.</hi>

               <p>IN this Chapter we ſhall conſider the <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>Metaline Work,</hi> as 'tis repreſented to us by Nature, in its <hi>Ferch</hi> or firſt Life; alſo the way and method ſhe takes in preparing and making it ready to our hands, that ſo we may be the better able by Art to manifeſt the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal</hi> Virtues therein contained: In order hereunto we think it convenient to lay before the Reader the manner how the <hi>ſeven ſuperior Eſſences</hi> were brought forth, alſo how theſe act for the Formation of the <hi>inferior ones:</hi> For although all things receive their Multiplication from the Power of the <hi>Univerſal,</hi> yet do they receive their living Formation from the <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stars</hi> or internal Light of Beings, as ſhall hereafter be more largely treated of; therefore we proceed thus:</p>
               <p>Behold, <hi>in the Beginning God created the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth, ard all things viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi> (as is ſaid in the Scriptures of Truth) from the <hi>Hyle</hi> or Vapor, and <hi>Chaos</hi> or confuſed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43169:58"/>Mountain of Water; concerning which we have largely written in other Volumes, and principally in our <hi>Ignis Aſtralis Adeptorum;</hi> but however, in ſhort, we ſay thus: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God moved upon the face of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and God ſaid let there be light, and there was light, and the light was ſeparated from the darkneſs, and the light was called day and the darkneſs night; ſo that day ſprung natively from the light, as a legitimate Heir from the Loins of his Parents, which noble Birth was illuminated with bountious Rays from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ocean, whence its Activity proceeded, and by which 'twas endued with its ſuperior Purity and fermentative Virtue, as the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Cauſe in bringing forth the firſt Birth of the Creation, <hi>ſc.</hi> Day, that ſo by the light thereof things might be diſtinguiſhed, as they really be: therefore to a true <hi>Philoſopher</hi> is the light moſt deſirable.</p>
               <p>Now in this we conceive, that in the <hi>Auro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> or Morning thereof, the firſt Planet, <hi>ſc. Saturn,</hi> had its original manifeſtation, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not endued with the full ſplendor of the day, (whence Purity proceeds) Saturnal Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and polluted Defilements muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently adhere unto him; and altho' he is ſlow of motion, yet is he honourable in his Houſe; for that he is Father of all the reſt, which by conſequence muſt be ſo, for through Corruption all Generation proceeds. And that this Generation might be the more compleat and perfect, the Omnipotent God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43169:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>and created a Firmament to divide the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Waters; ſo that the ſuperior and heavenly Waters (being moſt pure, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a light, permanent and contractive Virtue) might by the beams of their purity act in the Firmament to illuminate the inferior ones, and give them life and motion, by ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating and ſtirring up the aireal Spirit, which was no ſooner performed, but <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the noble Son of <hi>Saturn</hi> comes forth, with farther degrees of Purity and aireal Splendor.</p>
               <p>The Waters being gathered together in one place, the dry Land appeared, and the valiant <hi>Mars</hi> became viſible, and Champion like, through the fire, aſcended the Throne, next to aireal <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and Magnet like, attracts by the purity of his Earth, what is ſufficient to make the Sperm become Seed, and ſo it began to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porifie, and then was the Earth able to bring forth <hi>Trees, Herbs</hi> and <hi>Graſs,</hi> which by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation is the moſt <hi>Univerſal Vegitable;</hi> but 'twas yet too faint to bring out the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Minerals,</hi> which wanted a farther degree of Illumination, whence Purity and Permanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy proceed.</p>
               <p>Here the all-bountious Creator made two great Lights, and ſet them in the Firmament, to give light upon the Earth, to rule the Day and to rule the Night, to be for Signs and for Seaſons for Days and for Years: And the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Sol</hi> being advanc'd, fills the World with the Beauty of his dazling Rays, heating, and illuminating the Waters with the vivifying
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43169:59"/>Rays of Life, and the Earth being ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he attracts the ſuperfluous moiſture, and caſts it into the Air: This is the Office of that Potent <hi>Monarch,</hi> who hath no other Conſort but <hi>Lune,</hi> whoſe fair Beauty (according to the <hi>Philoſophers</hi>) equalizes his Brightneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Lineage, only borrowing her light Sulphur or heavenly Tincture from him.</p>
               <p>Now here the inferior Waters being anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and endued with Tincture, the glorious and half-tinged <hi>Venus</hi> became viſible; and therefore hath ſome right to Heaven, altho' the Daughter of the Ocean; and in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides much goodneſs; for here the bleſſing of Multiplication was given, and <hi>Mercury</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by whoſe Spirit all things grow, encreaſe and multiply; therefore is he ſtiled, <hi>The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Intelligencer and Lover of Mettals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;</hi> as alſo, <hi>The Communicator to Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.</hi>

               <p>Now the <hi>ſuperior Eſſences,</hi> being all formed and ſtrengthened by the <hi>active Light,</hi> became viſible Stars, ſhining in degrees of ſplendor, and were placed in the Heavens to give light upon the Earth, and to dart their Virtue to the Centre of the ſame; for (as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay) all their Rays meet there: for what end, will be ſeen anon.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>inferior ones</hi> had their original; for the ſpiritual Forms being elivated to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Orbs, and there being ſet to communicate Virtue to inferior Beings; the firſt Rays they caſt forth were endued with ſuch vital ſtrength, as to form <hi>Terreſtrial living Aſtrums;</hi> for the Earth, as then empty of Form, could not alter thoſe noble ones; and here the earthly Stars of <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> had their original; the heat of which, with a perpetual influx of Rays, kindles in the Centre the <hi>Archaeius</hi> or <hi>Terreſtrial Sun,</hi> which by his heat began the work of a vivifying <hi>Sublimation,</hi> and ſo from the <hi>Iliaſtes</hi> were <hi>Venus, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Lune</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and thus the Powers of <hi>Demogorgon</hi> were buſied in <hi>ſubliming</hi> the Vapour, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it from all Impurities; and on this did the <hi>ſuperior Eſſences</hi> ſtamp their own Forms, and ſo came the <hi>inferior Stars</hi> to ſhine with beauty, and to have an unalterable and determinated form; this is that which animates the <hi>metalick Ferch</hi> with life, and ſtill ſtamps it Progenitors impreſſion in the Act of Multiplication, and is in the Earth in their divers Spheres or Orbs, being the Life of <hi>Mettals,</hi> as the <hi>Anima</hi> is in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43169:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>Man's Body: Thus were the <hi>Celeſtial</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Stars</hi> formed, and the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the <hi>great World</hi> finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Now the Almighty God created a <hi>Microcoſmical World,</hi> from the purity of Superior and Inferior Beings, and ſtamped thereon a Divine Seal, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it as a Tranſcript of the original Copy, wherein Life and Dominion ſtood to rule over Beings; and thus was the great Work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion finiſhed, the ſeventh day being celebrated as a day of reſt for Man and Beaſt, that ſo the Lord our God might therein be ador'd, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor'd, worſhip'd and prais'd for theſe and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his mighty Works, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe <hi>ſuperior</hi> and <hi>inferior Eſſences</hi> ſtood in harmony, the one to be active, the other to be paſſive; the one to command, the other to obey: and ſo the great World formed a Seed, repreſenting that of which it was created, and is that <hi>Chaos</hi> of which all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> write, in which is contained the Virtue of ſuperior and inferior Beings; becauſe 'tis a Vapor or Airy Nature, ſtanding in a <hi>Medium</hi> between the <hi>Celeſtial</hi> and <hi>Terreſtrial Stars,</hi> and therefore unites the Power of the one unto the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Form of the other, being the life of the <hi>Ferch,</hi> and without which it cannot encreaſe nor multiply; therefore we ſay, that this is that ſpiritual Life that feeds the <hi>Metalline Spirit</hi> or <hi>Ferch</hi> in the <hi>Metalline Shop,</hi> both with Celeſtial and Terreſtrial Rays, for by the one it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and by the other fixed.</p>

               <p>By this 'tis clear to be diſcerned, that Seed had its original Birth from the <hi>heavenly Stars,</hi> and its determinated Form from the <hi>earthly ones;</hi> therefore by conſequence, the original Life or Seed of <hi>Mettals</hi> muſt be firſt ſpiritual, and in that ſtate 'twill receive the univerſal and multiplicative Power, and ſo is alter'd and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd, before 'tis brought to any bodily ſtate, and that this is really ſo is plain, or elſe <hi>Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> could never be brought to a <hi>Pluſquam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> by a multiplication of the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having as yet any determinated Form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that the <hi>Grand Eſſence</hi> in the <hi>Metalline Monarchy</hi> is rather a <hi>Genus</hi> than a <hi>Species,</hi> and ſo acts by a virtuous Power for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beings; for which reaſon the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> called it <hi>their Heaven, their Earth,</hi> becauſe it contains the Virtues of both; for as the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſts</hi> ſay, <hi>'tis a Mercurial Spirit, carrying all things on its wings, for it aſcendeth to Heaven, and deſcends to Hell, and dies for the Redemption of his defiled Brethren.

                  <p>Into theſe clear Vinegars, therefore being put in a Glaſs Veſſel, pour thereinto (by little and little) as much rectified Spirit of Salt, that ſo the yellow Vinegar may be turned into a white Milk, and may by little and little ſettle to the bottom like curdled Cheeſe, from which the Vinegar, being now become clear again, is to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43169:63"/>be removed by decanting; then put the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi> Cheeſe in ſome ſtrong Linnen Cloth, and tye it hard up, and ſqueeze out the reſidue of the moiſture, and ſo dry it and lay it by for uſe. It is a moſt tender Powder, of a bright ſnowy colour, and void of all taſte: for in the Precipitation, all the ſweetneſs being introvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of Salt, hath hidden it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which doth again by this following Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſcover its former taſte.</p>
                  <p>Buy ſome <hi>Steel Filings</hi> at the Needle makers, and take thereof as much as you pleaſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them in rectified Spirit of Salt, which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution will be green, and be of a ſweetiſh taſte; abſtract the inſipid Flegm, inſipid I ſay, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it be a very ſtrong Spirit of Salt, that is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Iron, yet nevertheleſs no Spirit comes off, but only an inſipid Flegm, in the abſtraction and diſtillation, and the Iron retains all the acidity of the Salt, and remains a red, ſweetiſh, aſtringent Juyce.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>this,</hi> and of the <hi>Saturnine Powder,</hi> which we taught you the making of but now, of each a like weight, and put them into a well coated Retort, and the <hi>Saccharum Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> will preſently drink up the Juyce of the Steel. Put the Retort in a Veſſel fill'd with Sand, and augment the fire by little and little, that all the inſipid Flegm may be wholly drawn off. When 'tis all come off, and acid drops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to come, then muſt you apply thereunto a Glaſs Receiver, and the fire is to be encreas'd by degrees, until the Retort be throughly red
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43169:63"/>hot, which muſt continue ſo about an hour, or half an hour at leaſt: by this means the Spirits of the Salt which were in the Steel, do almoſt wholly come over into the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and do carry over with them [the Spirits] of the <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> and Oyl of <hi>Mars,</hi> in the form of a red Sublimate, which ſettles it ſelf in the Neck of the Retort, which ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; when the Retort is cold and broken, you muſt take out of its Neck, and keep it from the Air; for in the Air 'twill diſſolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a red, ſweet and aſtringent Oyl, of no ſmall Virtues in <hi>Medicine</hi> and <hi>Alchimy.</hi> Furthermore, as <hi>Baſilius</hi> ſaith, if from <hi>calcined Saturn</hi> you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the cryſtaline Salt with <hi>diſtill'd Vinegar;</hi> and afterward, with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and diſtil it into a <hi>red Oyl. This Oyl cureth Melancholly, fiery Pox, old Ulcers, and many other Infirmities beſides.</hi> This Oyl coagulateth and fixeth <hi>Mercury,</hi> being firſt precipitated with <hi>Oyl of Vitreol,</hi> for all <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Medicaments,</hi> which are to make <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> muſt be made fix, holding in all fiery tryals.</p>

                  <p>Now as to the molten Maſs in the bottom of the Retort, reſembling <hi>Lapis Hematitis,</hi> which being ſeparated from all defilements, will give you a red, brittle, fuſile Stone, and in ſome ſort aſtringent, of great Virtues in <hi>Medicine,</hi> and without doubt in <hi>Alchimy</hi> too, if it were but firſt made conſtantly to abide in the fire. And
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43169:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>ever this too, muſt you keep from the Air, for it is ſtill impregnated with the Salts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is eaſily diſſolv'd.</p>
                  <p>Now when you would make uſe of this Stone in <hi>Medicine,</hi> break a little bit thereof into ſmall Powder (for 'tis no harder than other Salt, and therefore doth eaſily admit of grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Powder.) <hi>This Powder heals both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and external Wounds and Ulcers, being admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in the quantity of two, three four, five, ſix, or more Grains, according to the age and condition of the ſick, and being taken in a convenient and proper Vehicle, it is highly ſanative and a ſtopper of Blood. Being applied externally to Wounds, it wonderfully forwards healing; hinders all Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, and fundamentally drys and cures all Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Fiſtula's, if uſed outwardly and inwardly too.</hi>

               <p>WE have in this Treatiſe <hi>first</hi> laid down neceſſary Rules in this Art: <hi>2dly,</hi> The Way of advancing <hi>Vinor Spirits,</hi> and their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Uſes. <hi>3dly,</hi> Concerning <hi>Oyls,</hi> and how they are to be purifi'd. <hi>4thly,</hi> Concerning <hi>Salts.</hi> Now, by the way, 'tis requiſite to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that in the <hi>Oyls</hi> and <hi>Salts</hi> is the <hi>Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Virtue of any Concret, and therefore in the <hi>fifth place</hi> have we proceeded to the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> of <hi>Urine,</hi> and ſo to the Reconciling of theſe, in order to prepare <hi>Powers</hi> or <hi>Oleoſums;</hi> then to the preparing of <hi>Menſtruums</hi> and <hi>Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Medicines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you are to obſerve, that the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Virtues lyes in their Saline and more principally in their Sulphurous Qualities, for the <hi>Central Mercury</hi> of Bodies is a peerleſs <hi>Ens,</hi> and will not ſtoop to any thing, but the <hi>Grand Elixir,</hi> by which 'tis better'd, and that only by means of the <hi>Univerſal Sulphur,</hi> which is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſal of Light, having its original from the Fire, and therefore the Rays of Light ſhine there, as alſo in every true <hi>Specifick,</hi> wherein Sulphur is exalted <hi>[by it.]</hi> Theſe (in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43169:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>Monarchy</hi>) are the true <hi>Aurum Reginae</hi> in compariſon to others, the which every true experiencer will find by undeniable Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; we could indeed lay down many and particular Obſervations concerning both, but we are afraid if our Light ſhould really appear, that the Momes and Carpers of the Age would howl againſt it, as the Wolves of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> againſt the Moon; but ſuch we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to ſeek amongſt the Vulgar Slops for a Diſh to appeaſe their greedy Appetite; for ours is deſigned only for the true lovers of Art, to whom the <hi>Aſteria</hi> will ſhine, as long as the heavenly <hi>Phoebe</hi> doth, even from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Generation: for as he comes to be darkened, ſhe ſhall be turned into Blood, the fulneſs of whoſe Tincture is aurified, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all tryals, that greedy <hi>Saturn</hi> can no more make prey on it; for we ſay 'tis an Emblance of the Divine Paradiſe, in the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of which is the Tree of Life, whoſe Leaves are for Healing the Nations, without Money or Price: This we are now ſpeaking of, is that part of Art which is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on true Knowledge of Created Beings, and whe Manner how the Tranſmutation of Form will come about; for we ſay, that Mortality muſt put on Immortality, both in the leſſer and greater World; and here all the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Notions of Man's Wiſdom, as it ſtands in the Corruption and Elementary Nature, muſt be deſtroyed and burnt up with the Fire
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43169:88"/>of Regeneration, as all things at the laſt day by the general Fire of Conflagration; and as Man muſt come into the Innocency, that thinks no guile, ſo will the World into Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and then the Glory of Light will appear in its luſtre, which no Man now can behold, and live, and therefore ſays the Text, in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> Ch. 20. ver. 21. <hi>That Moſes drew near to the thick darkneſs, where God was.</hi> Thus is it plainly evident from Scripture, that the very Fountain of Light hath made uſe of the Vails of Darkneſs, in order to hide the unſpeakable Glory of his Light: For 'tis ſaid in the <hi>Pſalms, He hath made darkneſs his hiding-place.</hi> Why then may not the higheſt and moſt perfect of all Medicines be vailed over with black Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeeing Light it ſelf is ſo covered; which, that it is really ſo, is well known to the Sons of the <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi> Wiſdom, as we ſhall more largely ſhew in other Volumes; and although our Philoſophy is but as a Mite, yet will it encreaſe the Treaſury, being a good Coin and bearing the Stamp of the Great and Famous <hi>Hermes;</hi> therefore (ye Sons of Art) in the mean while accept thereof, until we can have while to tender our larger Coin, and then we know, that many will give us a free diſcharge, for performing our Duty in that Diſcipleſhip, where the People wait for the reſtoration of all things, that true Art may ſhine on the mighty Mount <hi>Hellicon</hi> in the midſt of Nations, that her Sons may
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43169:89"/>come from far, and her Daughters from the ends of the Earth, to ſit down at Wiſdom's Gate, in the Temple of which is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Life, where the Unity of Spirit and Bond of Peace is known, in the Frame of which are Prayers offered to the living God, that he will haſten what was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> Ch. 3. ver. 9. <hi>ſc.
